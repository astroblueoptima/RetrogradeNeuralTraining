# Retrograde Neural Training (RNT) 🧠

Enhance your time series predictions with the innovative RNT approach. Train models in both temporal directions, leveraging time symmetry for enhanced understanding and generalization.

## 🌟 Highlights

- **Bidirectional Learning**: Employs both anterograde (past-to-future) and retrograde (future-to-past) training mechanisms.
- **Temporal Fusion**: Combines insights from both training directions for robust predictions.
- **Enhanced Generalization**: Taps into patterns from the future to better understand past events, leading to superior model performance.
- **Versatility**: While our example uses time series data, RNT can be adapted for a range of applications where bidirectional context is beneficial.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone and Navigate**:
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-link>
   cd RNT-Implementation

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas scikit-learn

3. **Run the Magic**:
   ```bash
   python retrograde_neural_training.py

Note: Ensure the BTC-USD.csv dataset is in the directory for seamless execution!

📈 Dataset

We've showcased the RNT approach using the BTC-USD.csv dataset. This dataset provides daily Bitcoin prices and serves as a suitable example to demonstrate the RNT capabilities. Always keep the dataset in the repository root for optimal results.

🛠 Future Roadmap

🌐 Adapt RNT for other domains beyond time series, exploring its potential in areas like NLP or image processing.
🔍 Refine the temporal fusion mechanism to achieve even more accurate ensemble predictions.
📊 Explore deeper neural architectures, further pushing the boundaries of what RNT can achieve.
